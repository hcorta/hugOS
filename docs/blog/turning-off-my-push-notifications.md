There is a lot of noise these days. And the problem is the noise distract us from what really is important.

You wake up in the morning, grab it fully charged, spend the whole day squeezing it and returning it completely drained to the confortable rest of your bedside table at night, where it finally can recharge peacefully its battery until the next day... and repeat.

I am talking about your brain.

## Your brain battery

**Our brain runs on batteries**, just like your phone.

Just like your phone: the more you use it, the less battery you have left. Every day you wake up with a new set of batteries and you got to choose carefully which apps and how much do you use them, if you want to end up the day with some battery left.

Now, a few years ago, no problem incurred with this system: you'd wake up in the morning with a more-or-less clear idea of your objectives for the day, and then you'd spend that same day managing your brain power between them; with a considerable low deviation.

Nowadays, **the digital war for the attention of your brain is fierce-less** though. Tens of notifications in your phone asking you to please come back to their apps repeatedly, non-stop, 24/7. The companies behind those messages usually hold teams running large studies to find out the best way to bring you back. And they do for good: **few KPIs in the digital corporate resonate better to investors than the "*active users*" one.**

## They get to you everywhere

Push notifications have crossed the line that a digital marketing manager send years ago could have only dropped off: reach out any user anywhere at any time

Please, do not get me wrong: there are some notifications that are absolutely helpful.

I am sure you have found yourself more than you would have liked unconsciously checking  your phone. Or even worse, infinitely scrolling through a never-ending series of posts or short-looped videos.

Do not worry, we all do. You have just fallen in the trap ðŸ˜”. The way they do it is by creating "habits" in our brain: we will automatically execute some actions when some events are triggered but let's leave this topic for another occasion.

What worries me is that this process consume brain energy. More than we think. Your brain is being slowly drained from these processes, deviating its energy source to activities that are not among your objectives for the day (or even your interests!).

## Disconnected from the grid

I have turned off all my notifications. All of them.

For work-related issues, I periodically check my main communication channels, mainly in the morning, midday, and before leaving. Messaging apps are secondary channels of communication that are meant to be used for non-important cases.

Trust me: if it is that important, they will call.
