These days, creating a personal website is pretty easy. You don’t need to know about web hosting or code. You don’t even have to have tons of content — just one landing page is all you need to stake out your spot on the web.

## So, it’s easy, but is it necessary?

We have entered the digital era, and the world runs more on the internet than outside of it.

Of course, answering whether it's necessary or not may drastically vary depending on the conditions for each individual (profession, age, etc.) that will determine how much will she care about her online presence.

Nonetheless, in case you’re doubting about having your personal space online or not, here are some important reasons for me to do so:

### 1. Control your branding

There is a huge competition found in whatever field you are in. Success in your line of work will ultimately depend on your ability to stand out from your peers. This is where having a strong brand identity comes in. Your personal website can allow you to establish the exact details that define what you are about, starting with your bio and profile picture.

Having your own controlled space where you can truly express yourself is very important. Within there you’re not restricted by any condition or policy rules as in other platforms. You fully control your content as well as how it’s presented. Therefore it’s the most personal way to really introduce yourself online.

### 2. Improve online presence

In these times not being present online is close to non-existing at all, and while this is not mandatory, I would recommend you to taking it into account considering its benefit/cost radio: owning a domain is not expensive anymore (I’ve paid 45,62€ for 5 years owning [hugocorta.com](https://hugocorta.com/)) and there are thousands of no-code options out there that may help you to publish. Think how difficult for a person looking for you is to find out about you on the Internet.

### 3. Show your work

One of the most interesting aspects of owning a personal website is that you have a space where you can show what you do and openly talk about it. Think of it as your personal portfolio where you can show other people what you do.

Setting up your own website allows you to showcase your work and provide proof about your abilities. This is a must if you are in one of the creative fields such as writing, designing, art, music, etc. While you can list out your skills on your resume, having a portfolio lets people see exactly what you did.

## Takeaway

Absolutely anyone can own a personal website, and it can be about anything you want. The only question you are probably left with is when/how to start one. There are many options available to you in this regard and I'm sure that a quick search online will help you with it.

Hope that helps.
