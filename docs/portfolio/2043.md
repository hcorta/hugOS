**2043** is a graphic experiment I created to put into practice some concepts I wanted to explore, like the browser capacity to handle a high volume of objects/calculations simultaneously as well as creating my own rendering engine in plain JavaScript.

## Motivation

While the main idea for the project was to create a full game from it, including levels, points, etc., I haven’t been able to find the proper time to finish the project, though someday I’d like to come back over it.

## Render engine

This project was created in plain JS with no libraries, and the main concept for the calculation were basic concepts from the conic perspective I learnt in architectural drawing.

Any object in the image (blocks, shadows, clouds, etc) is just a combination of lines and coloured areas calculated based on the angle regardless the perspective point.

Under the hood, any object on the screen is a class instance (different from the type) that updates its x,y coordinates 60 times per second (60 FPS), therefore resulting in the animation of the object.

As I said earlier, I would love to make a full game out of it but it’s difficult to find some time to dedicate time to it. In the meantime… well it’s a funny thing to try.
