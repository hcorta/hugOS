`react-notion-x` is a fantastic **Notion renderer for React**, and the main engine I used to build my old personal website (as well as some other projects).

## Motivation

Since I discovered it, I’ve participated several times in its maintenance and improvement, therefore becoming **one of the main contributors** to the project.
