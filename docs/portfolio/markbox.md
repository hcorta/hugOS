**Markbox is a note-taking app based on the markdown syntax.** It offers a set of very powerful features like:

- in-app storage
- collections management
- real-time preview
- note pinning
- search
- Themes
- document download
- …and many more.

> 😔 The app currently does not work since Heroku took down the server due to inactivity.

## Motivation

Markbox was my first project as developer and it was **fully defined, designed and coded in 10 days** along with [Anna Fredriksson](https://github.com/annaclf) as our final Ironhack Web Dev Bootcamp project.

I always loved the minimal but powerful simplicity that markdown brings to the table. When thinking about what our project should be about, I quickly came to think about it. After some discussions with Anna, we decided to use it as a main topic for the project.

10 frenetic non-stop-coding days and a bunch of life-crisis moments later, we finished this super complete app.

I’m really proud about what we did in the time we had, also considering that we had seen Angular for just 5 days the previous week and we had to learn along the process.

The project is currently down since Heroku shot down the server due to its inactivity policy. I need to find the time to get it back to work.
