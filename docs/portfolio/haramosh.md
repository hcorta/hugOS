**Haramosh** if a theme I created for VSCode. If you happen to use this IDE for coding, you might consider giving it a chance.

## Motivation

I consider very important the theme you choose for your IDE, since I believe that improves readability and it helps you to focus on the content. After trying a whole lot of them and not feeling like I was feeling comfortable, I decided to create my own and publish it.
