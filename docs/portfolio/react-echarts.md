[Apache ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html) is a free, powerful charting and visualisation library offering intuitive, interactive, and highly customisable charts.

**React ECharts** is an abstraction wrapper that I built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) on top of Apache ECharts.

## Motivation

While there are some other wrappers around ECharts for React already published, I could not find anyone that really implemented some of the core concepts of React. My intention was creating an easy-to-use React component that’d expose most of ECharts functionalities through props.
