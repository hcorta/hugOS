This is sample content. The section above is called Frontmatter where we can add post metadata like title and author. You can add as little or as many properties in the frontmatter using YAML syntax.

My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com).

**Since everyone has her personal preference, I have decided not to include any option and leave that decision to be taken by the dev.**

### Commands

```bash
- `dev`: runs your application on `localhost:3000`
- `build`: creates the production build version
- `start`: starts a simple server with the build production code
- `lint`: runs the linter in all components and pages
- `test`: runs jest to test all components and pages
- `test:watch`: runs jest in watch mode
```
