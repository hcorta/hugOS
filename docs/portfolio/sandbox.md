This is my collection of samples and i experiments I have written in HTML and CSS and JavaScript. There are some pretty cool feels like a JavaScript game or a drum kit biltong HTML. Try it out.

## Motivation

Basically I use this repo when I want to try some stuff or try out a new thing I found somewhere.
