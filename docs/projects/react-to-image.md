[html-to-image](https://github.com/bubkoo/html-to-image) is a free utility library that generates an image from a DOM node using HTML5 canvas and SVG.

**`react-to-image`** is an implementation built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) on top of **`html-to-image`**

## Motivation

While there are some other wrappers around html-to-image for React already published, I could not find a proper one that would really implement some of the core concepts of React. My intention was creating an easy-to-use React hook that’d expose most of html-to-image functionalities in a declarative way.
